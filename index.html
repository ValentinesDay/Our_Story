<div class="first_date">
  <p>first date<span class="date">june 15</span><br />
  <small>There once was a geeky boy & a slightly nerdy girl each searching for each other, but never knowing it. One day the meet online & exchange message. This leads to the geeky boy asking the slightly nerdy girl out. The geek & the slightly nerdy girl meet at Bad Apple & sit down for burgers, beers, conversation about everything! They realized their food was done, but neither wanted to leave the other, so across the street to a bar they went. They continued to drink & talk & talk & drink, until the slightly nerdy girl must leave. She makes a quick goodbye & hopes he'll text her again.</small></p>
</div>
<div class="brewery">
  <p>brewery tour <span class="date">june 22</span><br />
  <small>The text comes and it’s an invitation to tour their local brewery. The following week, the slightly nerdy girl finds herself meeting the geeky boy in line (& a slight drizzle). One great tour & three drinks later, the two start a search for food. This will not be the last time they ask each other "Where do you want to go?" They end up at Fountainhead for a roof top lunch. Talk turns to friends, family, birthdays (9/22 for her & the following Friday for him!) & more. They talk &drink in the sunshine until he must meet a friend to watch the Blackhawks playoff game.</small></p>  
</div>
<div class="hawks">
  <p>hawks win!<span class="date">june 24</span><br />
  <small>The Blackhawks win & the championship is the following Tuesday. The geeky boy & slightly nerdy girl make plans to watch the game at a bar. They watch the game, cheer for each goal, eat, drink some beers & sit on the edge of their seats as the game changes from a certain loss to a win in the last minute of the game. Throughout the night & in the excitement of the championship win both feel the desire to kiss each other but the opportunity passes them by. The geeky boy escorts the slightly nerdy girl to a taxi --- next time they both say!</small></p>
</div>
<div class="birthday">
  <p>birthday & first kiss<span class="date">june 28</span><br />
  <small>That following Friday (the geeky boy’s birthday) they find themselves at a restaurant ordering a bottle of wine & eating delicious food. Afterwards they move to a loud bar where their mutual poor hearing forces them to sit closer & close. Every inch closer and each touch is electric! After confirmation that it is no longer his birthday (first kisses shouldn't very be confused with birthday kisses) they exit the bar & kiss for the first time!</small></p>
</div>
<div class="fall">
  <p>summer romance turns into fall romance<span class="date">fall 2013</span><br />
  <small>The geeky boy & slightly nerdy girl continues the dinners, drinks, and activities - picnics, music in the parks, street festivals, cheering on half marathon (& bringing much needed iced coffees), flowers, the slightly nerdy girls birthday, Lincoln Park Zoo lights, nights watching Break Bad, lazy Sundays filled with football & cooking, meeting each other’s family & friends, spending Thanksgiving at the geeky boys family, one fantasy football champion, a hundred bets, a thousand laughs, a million text messages, & billion of kisses brings is to New Year's Eve.</small></p>
</div>
<div class="nye">
  <p>new year's eve 2014<span class="date">december 31</span><br />
  <small>After exchanging Christmas gifts (a wireless soil moisture sensor from him & a thesaurus & Settlers Of Catan from her) the couple take in a quiet dinner at Francesca's & then set off to Emporium for midnight toasts of Malört. Down the snowy street they walked when the slightly nerdy girl slightly blurted out "I love you!"</small></p>
</div>
<div class="vday">
  <p>valentine's day<span class="date">february 14</span><br />
  <small>A cold January starts off, but not for this couple! Dining out & cooking, building robots, meeting friends, going to parties, skiing  on “mountains” & making future plans - Oscar Movie Marathons, additions & subtraction to the dinning list, cashing in on bets, lazy Sundays & celebrating holidays keep this couple warm & looking towards the future. So on this Valentine's Day, the slightly nerdy girl learns coding (well some) & builds a website for now & the future!</small></p>

<div class="future">
